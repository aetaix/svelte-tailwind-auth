# SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS

This is a template for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) apps, blend with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Developing

Once you've pulled the project, install all dependencies with 

```bash 
npm install
```

Then start [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
